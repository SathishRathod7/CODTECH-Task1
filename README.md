Overview of the Project

Project: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Objective:        
 The primary goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a chosen dataset to understand its underlying structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights. EDA helps in 
  making informed decisions for subsequent data processing steps, feature selection, and model building in machine learning projects.

Key Activities:         
  1.Dataset Selection: Choose a dataset relevant to the problem domain or area of interest.    
  2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values through imputation or removal,Correct data types if necessary,Remove duplicates and irrelevant data     
  3. Data Transformation: Feature scaling and normalization,Encode categorical variables if necessary,Create new features from existing ones if applicable    
  4. Data Visualization: Visualize findings with histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps using matplotlib and seaborn.     

Technologies Used:         
 1.Python: Programming Language     
 2.pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.     
 3. numpy: for numerical operations and array handling.     
 4. matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.    
 5. seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
